## INTERN EXPERIENCE

### Tencent~Data Platform~/Algorithm Engineer (Ads)  &emsp;&emsp; Aug. 2021 -- May. 2022
 User interest modeling. Use information from different domains to model user behavior and improve the accuracy of click prediction model. 
 
 Delayed feedback modeling. Adaptively adjust the elapsed time of click samples to improve the accuracy of conversion rate prediction. 

## PROJECT EXPERIENCE

### MAKE: Multi-level Aggregated Knowledge-Based Embedding for Recommender Systems (SIGIR-2021 Under Review) 

The goal of this project is to implement Top-K recommendation based on knowledge graph and bipartite graph.

### Scheduling Jobs across Geo-Distributed Data Centers 

The goal of this project is to reasonably use the topological network between data centers and make full use of bandwidth to minimize data transmission time.

### Lightweight Recommender System based on Graph Neural Network

The goal of this project is to implement Top-K recommendation by redesigning the aggregation function of nodes on the bipartite graph based on low-pass filtering characteristics of GNN.
