## PROJECT EXPERIENCE

### MAKE: Multi-level Aggregated Knowledge-Based Embedding for Recommender Systems (SIGIR-2021 Under Review) 

The goal of this project is to implement Top-K recommendation based on knowledge graph and bipartite graph.

### Scheduling Jobs across Geo-Distributed Data Centers 

The goal of this project is to reasonably use the topological network between data centers and make full use of bandwidth to minimize data transmission time.

### Lightweight Recommender System based on Graph Neural Network

The goal of this project is to implement Top-K recommendation by redesigning the aggregation function of nodes on the bipartite graph based on low-pass filtering characteristics of GNN.
