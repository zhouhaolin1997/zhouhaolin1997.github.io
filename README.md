## INTERN EXPERIENCE

### Tencent/Data Platform/Algorithm Engineer (Ads)  &emsp;&emsp; Aug. 2021 -- May. 2022
 User interest modeling. Use information from different domains to model user behavior and improve the accuracy of click prediction model. 
 
 Delayed feedback modeling. Adaptively adjust the elapsed time of click samples to improve the accuracy of conversion rate prediction. 

## PROJECT EXPERIENCE

### Temporal User Interest Model (NIPS 2022, under review)
The goal is to consider position information in both attention and representation module while modeling user interest. 

### Delayed Feedback Modeling based on Reinforcement Learning 

The goal is to improve the accuracy of conversion rate prediction by modeling the elapsed time.
